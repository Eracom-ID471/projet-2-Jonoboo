Paul Walker, the star of the Fast and Furious film franchise, died after the car he was in crashed at a speed of more than 100mph and burst into flames, according to the coroner's report released on Friday.

Walker, 40, was found dead along with his friend and financial adviser Roger Rodas on 30 November in a burnt-out Porsche Carrera GT in Los Angeles.

The coroner's report said Walker died of the combined effects of traumatic and thermal injuries while Rodas, the driver, died of multiple traumatic injuries. No drugs or alcohol were detected in either men.

Kristy McCracken, the investigator for the Los Angeles coroner, described how the car was driving at unsafe speed in an easterly direction. "For an unknown reason the driver lost control of the vehicle and the vehicle partially spun around and began to travel in a south-easterly direction.

"The vehicle then struck a sidewalk and the driver's side struck a tree and then a lightpost. The force of these collisions caused the vehicle to spin 180 degrees and it continued to travel in an easterly direction," the report states.

"The passenger side of the vehicle then struck a tree and it then burst into flames."

The coroner said the Porsche was found "totalled with major traffic collision damage all around and it appeared that the vehicle was almost split in half." The report found no evidence of foul play.

Walker was still filming scenes for Fast and Furious 7 when the accident happened. The film is expected to be released later this year.

Walker and Rodas were the owners of a motor racing team and Rodas was also a professional driver.
