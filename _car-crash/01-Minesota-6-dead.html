Six people, including an 11-year-old, were killed early Friday in a Minnesota's deadliest crash since 2010, officials said.

The two-vehicle crash, which happened just after 1:30 a.m. on Interstate 90 near Eyota, southeast of Minneapolis, involved a wrong-way driver, the Minnesota State Patrol said in an incident report.

A 2008 Ford Focus was headed the wrong way when it struck a 2005 Chrysler Sebring, police said.

Each vehicle had three people in it, and they all died. Several were not wearing seat belts, according to the patrol. It was unknown if the child was restrained.

One of the vehicles caught fire after the crash.
