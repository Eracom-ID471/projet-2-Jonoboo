The driver of a B-double was seen swerving before he ploughed into three other trucks at M1 roadworks on the NSW Central Coast and was allegedly “ejected” before an explosive fire.

Traffic at the scene north of Halloran, near Wyong, was backed up nine kilometres and would take some hours to clear, police said.

At about 2.10am, the B-double crashed into the back of a stationary truck “that was displaying a sign to merge over to the other lane”, Chief Inspector Colin Lott told reporters today.

He said the driver “failed to stop” before the first collision, which sent the signage vehicle into a Roads and Maritime Services truck, forcing it into a third RMS vehicle like dominoes.
